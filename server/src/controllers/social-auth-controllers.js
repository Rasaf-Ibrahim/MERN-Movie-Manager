        If req.user exists, it means that the login process was successful, and the user session information is available in the browser cookie.

        However, our application requires more than just a successful login with the provider (the provider can be Google or Facebook or Twitter or Github). We need to attempt to create a user document in our database using the information from the user session cookie.

        Moreover, our plan is to send token for authentication and authorization. We need the session cookie only at the time of authenticating with the provider and couple of more seconds to get the info of the user. And the maxAge for the cookie session is set just for 2 minutes so that we don't need to manually delete the session when we don't need it.
