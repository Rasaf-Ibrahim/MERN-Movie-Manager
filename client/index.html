    <!-- 
        For android, the manifest.json file is enough for creating a progressive web app (PWA). It provides the necessary metadata for the app to be installed on the user's device and run as a standalone app, without the need for an extra file such as an apple-touch-icon.

    <!--
      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/


      There is a manifest generator, you can use that: https://www.simicart.com/manifest-generator.html/
